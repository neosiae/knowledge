# Object-oriented programming

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows you to write code that works without mention of any specific type and can be used transparently with any number of new types, as long as they support the interface your code expects.

## Getters and Setters

Properties that are accessed directly may hide a method call. Such methods are called _getters_ and _setters_. They are useful for controlling how the data can be accessed or changed.

## Static method

Sometimes you want to create a method that belongs to a class rather than an object so you don't have to create an instance of the class to access it. This type of method is called a static method.

# Programming

## Call stack

The call stack is a data structure that records where in the program you are. It has two simple operations `push` and `pop`. If we step into the function we push something onto the stack, if we return from the function we pop off the top of the stack. The key part of the behavior of the call stack is the "Last In - First Out" or LIFO principle.

## Higher-order functions

Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.

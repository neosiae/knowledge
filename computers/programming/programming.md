# Programming

## Call stack

The call stack is a data structure that records where in the program you are. It has two simple operations `push` and `pop`. If we step into the function we push something onto the stack, if we return from the function we pop off the top of the stack. The key part of the behavior of the call stack is the "Last In - First Out" or LIFO principle.

## Higher-order functions

Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.

## Addresses

When we declare a variable, a computer sets some space in its memory to store the value of that variable. The space that the computer allocates is called an address. Each address is marked as a unique numerical value.

Every time we use a variable, what we are really doing is retrieving the value stored at that variable's address.

## Pointers

Pointers are variables that store addresses.

## Dereferencing

Dereferencing is used to access or manipulate data saved in an address pointed to by a pointer.

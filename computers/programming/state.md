# State

Make state more predictable.

## Store

Instead of having your state spread across through your entire application, you can put your state in one location. Let's call this location _State Tree_.

Interactions with the state tree:

* Get - Get the state from the state tree.
* Listen - Listen for whenever the state tree changes.
* Update - Update the state tree.
